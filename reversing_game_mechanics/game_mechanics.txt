Created 2015-09-01, with data between 0 and 2 weeks old.

Units used:
	distances, sizes are measured in raw agar.io coordinates.
	times are measured in frames. The game ran at 27-28 FPS at the time
		where this document was created
	speeds are measured in distance / number of frames



cellspeed = 86.05 / cellsize**0.45

zoom level is 369.399 * sum(own_cells.size) ** 0.431776

ejecting mass:
	prerequisite: size >= 60, i.e. mass >= 35
	you will lose 16 mass, but only gain 12 mass if you eat the blob
	one can eat ejected mass if mass >= 18 i.e. size >= 43

	75% of the ejects had a deviation smaller than 0.39 rad = 22.16 deg
	from the original moving direction of the shooting cell

	they fly 44-45px, starting from shooting cell's border.

splitting:
	75% of the splits had a deviation smaller than 0.02 rad = 1.19 deg
	from the original moving direction of the parent

	flight distance: unknown, somewhere between 100 - 650, max = 1205

	re-union will usually become possible somewhere after 745 - 790 frames
		this means that your cells are possible to glide into each
		other. depending on your movement pattern they will actually
		merge sooner or later.

feeding viruses:
	75% of the splits had a deviation smaller than 0.00 rad = 0.11 deg
	from the ejected mass movement vector.

	maximum distance is 580 from the midpoint of the parent virus.
	not sure about the minimum (too few data), but probably also 580?

	Viruses can have the following sizes:
		100, 106, 113, 119, 125, 131, 136.
		Sometimes 141 is also observed, but those viruses will split
		almost instantly (bug in the server software?)
	i.e., feed a virus with size 100 6 times to maximum size, and one more
	time to make it duplicate.

eating:
	a cell can eat us, if their size/mass(??) is at least 1.25* our size/mass
	a cell eats another, if the smaller one's midpoint is within the
	larger one's circle (with radius = size)
